A conceptual visualization of the “Perspective” app’s minimal interface. The design emphasizes a personal, voice-first journaling experience layered gently over the user’s world.

Perspective MVP: Technical & UX Research Findings

Overview: Perspective is a spiritually-grounded, 12-step inspired inventory app focusing on deep personal reflection rather than commercial goals. The MVP should implement a five-column inventory workflow (resentment/fear/harm in Column 1, then cause, threat, defect, and spiritual asset in Columns 2–5) with support for voice-driven journaling, AI-assisted but non-directive prompts, and a trauma-informed, safe UX. Below we provide structured recommendations for each focus area, including data architecture, voice interface design, AI integration, privacy considerations, trauma-informed design principles, spiritual insight features, and nonlinear daily practices. The tone and design must remain spiritually respectful, emotionally safe, and technically sound.

Spiritual Inventory Architecture
Multi-Column Data Model: Represent each inventory entry as an object capturing the five-column flow: Subject (Column 1), Cause/Nature (Column 2), Threat or Affected Part of Self (Column 3), Defect/Block (Column 4), and Spiritual Asset/Action (Column 5). This corresponds to the classic 12-step inventory structure (e.g. resentment -> cause -> how it affects me -> my part/defect -> corrective spiritual principle) . For flexibility, include a field for the inventory type (Resentment, Fear, or Harm) since the flow can start with any of these in Column 1 . Each entry should also store timestamps and an optional cluster ID or tags for grouping (see below).

Non-Linear Traversal & Grouping: Design the data model and UI to allow branching and linking of entries. As the user works through an inventory, the app may prompt whether a resentment reminds them of another situation or person . If the user chooses, the app should let them start a new linked entry (with a new subject in Column 1) without losing context. Technically, implement this by linking entries via a group identifier or cross-references, so that multiple resentments can be associated under one core theme (e.g. all resentments related to abandonment). This “cluster” logic lets the user later view patterns across entries – for example, seeing all resentments rooted in a fear of rejection grouped together . The UI should make this branching intuitive, perhaps offering an “Explore this pattern” button that jumps to a new entry flow while recording the linkage. Non-linear navigation also means the user can move back and forth between columns freely if needed – ensure the data model supports saving partial progress in earlier columns and returning later.

Sentence Evolution & Reverse Reading: Column 2 (Cause/Nature) uses a dynamic sentence builder that evolves as the user answers prompts . For implementation, use a template that concatenates the user’s inputs into one flowing sentence. For example, the user might record: “They played loud music and ignored me” (Column 2 initial event) which the app then displays. Next, the user answers how it made them feel: “…which made me feel disrespected and powerless” – the app appends this to the sentence in real time . Finally, the user identifies the belief: “…because I believed my boundaries should be respected.” The completed sentence (“They played music late and ignored me, which made me feel disrespected and powerless, because I believed boundaries should be respected.”) is stored as the Column 2 narrative . Implement this by updating the text view live with each new clause; use subtle animations to highlight new additions, giving a sense of “unfolding” insight. The belief sub-field in Column 2 is crucial – it captures the unconscious expectation or assumption the user held . Provide a structured way to store these beliefs (possibly as a choice from common categories plus a free-text field) since they’ll be reused for pattern detection.

After the user completes all columns, implement the Reverse Reading feature: reconstruct and present the narrative from Column 5 back to Column 1 . For example, show a summary like: “Spiritual Asset: Humility → Defect: Pride → Threat: Self-esteem → Belief: ‘I deserve more respect’ → Event: They ignored me at the party.” This reverse sequence helps the user see the spiritual logic of their resentment unfolding . Technically, generate this by pulling the final chosen asset (Col5), the identified defects (Col4), the threatened part of self (Col3), the core belief (Col2), and the original trigger event (Col2 or Col1 detail). Store each component so that it can be easily concatenated or formatted. In the UI, consider highlighting each part in a distinct color or label (e.g. asset in green, defect in red, etc.) to reinforce the asset–defect–belief–event flow . Optionally, allow a reflection playback mode where this reverse reading is delivered as audio or an animation, reinforcing the insight in a calm, meditative manner .

Ego/Fear Pattern Clustering: The architecture should capture underlying themes that may recur. Column 3 (Threatened self) will be structured around key ego constructs (self-esteem, pride, ambition, security, relations, etc.) each with an associated fear . The app can present Column 3 as a guided introspection (possibly a checklist or selection of which area was affected) rather than free text, since it maps to known categories (e.g. “it affected my self-esteem – fear of feeling worthless”) . Storing these as categorical data enables automatic grouping: e.g., mark an entry with fear_of_inferiority if “false pride” issues were triggered . Later, the system can list all resentments that share the same fear or ego defense mechanism. This provides the user a bird’s-eye view of their most common spiritual challenges (for instance, noticing that fear of rejection underlies many of their resentments). Implement grouping either via the aforementioned cluster ID or by tagging entries with the identified core fears/beliefs. The app can then offer an insight dashboard or simple list of recurring patterns (e.g. “🔗 3 resentments linked to fear of abandonment”). This clustering logic should remain optional and user-controlled – e.g. present it as a gentle suggestion: “It looks like several of your entries involve a fear of betrayal. Would you like to view them together?” – to avoid overwhelming the user who might not be ready to see patterns until they’ve done a few entries .

Edge Cases & Notes: Ensure the data model allows incomplete entries or saving a draft, as users might stop mid-inventory if it becomes emotionally intense. Also allow a way to mark entries as Fear or Harm inventories (which slightly alters the prompts) without forcing a different data structure – e.g. a boolean flag for “isFearInventory” can switch Column 1’s prompt from “Towards whom are you angry?” to “What are you afraid of?” . The architecture should be flexible enough that future inventory types (like a gratitude inventory or others) could be added without a complete overhaul – likely by extending the model or adding new columns. However, for MVP, focus on resentments (which encompass fears and harms by extension). Finally, incorporate a sponsor note or share flag on entries intended to be shared in read-only form, since the concept includes possibly sharing inventories with a sponsor for accountability . That suggests down the line, entries might sync to a secure cloud if the user opts in. For now, design local data structures in a way that cloud sync can be added (for example, a unique entry UUID and a sync status flag).

Voice-First and Emotionally-Aware Interfaces
Voice-Driven Journaling: Perspective is “voice-first,” meaning users should be able to speak their inventory entries naturally, as if confessing or reflecting out loud, rather than typing. On iOS, leverage the speech-to-text (STT) capabilities in a privacy-conscious way. Two strong options are: (a) Apple’s built-in Speech framework for on-device dictation, and (b) the open-source Whisper model by OpenAI running on-device. Whisper has demonstrated highly accurate transcription and can run offline on modern devices (e.g. apps like Whisper Notes use the Whisper AI model fully on-device for “total privacy” ). Using an on-device model ensures the sensitive spoken content never leaves the user’s phone . The trade-off is model size and speed: Whisper’s smaller models (~1–2 GB) may work in near real-time on an A12 Bionic or later iPhone , though possibly with a slight delay for long monologues. Apple’s native dictation is optimized and can stream results live with low latency, but one must confirm if it can remain fully offline for the target languages. If it falls back to cloud processing, that would violate the privacy mandate unless explicitly consented. Recommendation: Prefer an on-device STT approach for MVP to maximize user trust. If using Whisper, consider integrating via a framework like whisper.cpp (C++ ONNX runtime) or Core ML conversion of Whisper models. Start with English model (as the app content is very English-centric spiritually) – support for other languages can follow if needed.

Real-Time Transcription & Feedback: The UI should make voice journaling feel natural and emotionally safe. Provide a clear microphone toggle or “Hold to talk” button with appropriate affordances. While recording, show feedback – for example, a subtle waveform animation or transcription text appearing in real time. Seeing their words appear can reassure users that their feelings are being captured. However, be mindful that trauma-impacted users might speak haltingly or correct themselves mid-sentence. Ensure the transcription is tolerant of hesitations, fillers, and corrections. Modern ASR models can capture disfluencies (“um”, stutters), which may clutter the text. Implement a post-processing step to clean up transcripts by removing filler words and repeated fragments, improving readability . (Research on disfluency correction shows it’s feasible to automatically strip out fillers and false starts to create fluent text without altering meaning .) This cleaning should be gentle – perhaps keep an original raw transcript internally, but present a lightly edited version to the user so they aren’t distracted or embarrassed by seeing “uhm, I guess, kind of…” in their inventory. The goal is to let their true voice come through clearly.

Accommodating Hesitant Speech: Anticipate that users may pause or get choked up while speaking about painful events. The voice interface should not rush them. Use a relatively long silence timeout before assuming they’ve finished a thought. For example, if no speech is detected for ~5-7 seconds (tunable), consider that the user might be done with that prompt’s answer – but even then, perhaps prompt gently: “Take your time. Tap the mic again when you’re ready to continue.” rather than automatically jumping ahead. This respects a trauma survivor’s need to gather themselves. Additionally, provide an easy way to undo or edit a dictated entry. Emotional speech can sometimes be mis-transcribed; users should feel in control to fix a word or two if the app misheard them. A simple edit icon next to the transcribed text that allows them to type corrections would suffice – preserving choice and control which are vital in trauma-informed design .

Voice UI Elements: Keep the voice recording UI minimalistic and non-intrusive. Possibly a single prominent microphone icon that, when active, gently pulsates. Avoid flashy or rapid animations that might startle. The color scheme should be calming (e.g. soft blues or greens) to reinforce a feeling of safety. Provide textual or symbolic indication of which Column/prompt the user is answering while they speak (“Recording – Column 2: What happened?”) so they have context. After they finish speaking, the app can display the captured sentence or key phrases. Where possible, read back key points to the user in a soothing voice: e.g., after Column 2 is assembled, the app might use text-to-speech (TTS) to softly play back the full sentence (“They played loud music… because I believed boundaries should be respected”). iOS’s AVSpeechSynthesizer with a neutral, warm voice can handle this offline. This playback serves as an audio mirror, letting the user hear their own story articulated, which can foster insight or emotional release. It also aligns with the idea of a “spiritual mirror” reflection later on . Always allow the user to skip or disable these playbacks if they prefer silence – choice is key.

Emotional Attunement in Prompts: The interface and the AI prompts should be sensitive to the user’s emotional state. While we cannot know exactly how the user feels, we can infer from context and content. For example, if the user’s voice was trembling or the content includes strong words (“I hate…”, “I’m terrified…”), the next prompt should be extra gentle. The system might say (via voice or on-screen) “I hear how painful this is. You’re doing great – let’s continue when you’re ready.” Such empathetic affirmations, while brief, can make the user feel held. Technically, detecting emotional tone from voice could be done using amplitude, speech rate, or even a classifier for emotion from audio, but that may be complex and error-prone for MVP. A simpler approach: use the content of the transcript and perhaps an NLP sentiment analysis to gauge negativity or distress. If very negative or extreme words are present, the app can switch to a more soothing prompt script. Pre-define a set of supportive phrases to inject as needed. Importantly, never appear shocked or alarmed by what the user says – always respond with compassion and neutrality (e.g. “thank you for sharing that”). The prompts provided in the inventory script already have a gentle tone (e.g. “What do you feel is threatened or interfered with?” instead of a blunt “What part of self is affected?”) . Adhere to that style and possibly expand it in voice. For instance, if a user is struggling to identify a fear, the voice prompt could softly add, “It’s okay if you’re not sure – take a deep breath and see if any small worry comes to mind.” Such additions make the experience more like a caring guide than a form to fill.

Real-Time Column 2 Builder: The Column 2 sentence builder should function in real-time, as noted. From a technical perspective, this could be implemented by listening for pauses in the user’s speech or structuring Column 2 input as multiple steps. One design is to break Column 2 into sub-prompts: (1) “What happened?” (the user describes the external event), (2) “How did it make you feel?” (user describes feelings/reactions), and (3) “What belief or expectation of yours was involved?” (user states the belief). After each sub-prompt, the partial sentence is updated. This phased approach might actually ease the cognitive load on users – one smaller question at a time. It also enables the app to do things like rephrase the user’s words for clarity. For example, if the user says in step 1: “My friend betrayed my trust,” the app could display exactly that. If in step 2 they say, “I felt hurt and angry,” the app could append “which made me feel hurt and angry.” If they then voice a belief like “People shouldn’t betray me if they truly care,” the app completes: “…because I believed people who care about me shouldn’t betray my trust.” Minor grammatical adjustments (like matching plural/singular, adding “…because I believed”) can be handled via simple rules or by an LLM rephrasing with a prompt like “Combine these fragments into one sentence.” The key is the immediacy of feedback – users see their evolving statement and gain clarity from it in the moment . This can be emotionally relieving, as described in the concept: seeing the “exact nature” of the resentment crystallize provides relief . Make sure this UI is smooth: no jarring flicker when updating text; perhaps use a crossfade or highlight new text in a subtle way. Also, allow the user to manually tweak the sentence if something sounds off to them – this again supports agency.

Accessibility & Alternatives: While voice is primary, ensure there’s a fallback for those who cannot or do not want to speak (some may feel self-conscious or be in a private environment). A traditional text journaling interface should parallel the voice input. In fact, the dynamic prompts and sentence builder can work with typed input in the same way. For MVP, you might implement voice and text input interchangeably (e.g. a user could speak part of it, then type a bit more, etc.). This not only improves accessibility but also covers cases where STT might fail for heavy accents or noisy backgrounds. Moreover, some users might review their spoken entries later and prefer to edit via typing. The design should be multimodal in this sense, without forcing one mode.

Spiritually Attuned AI
Role of AI (LLM) in Guidance: The app will employ a Large Language Model to act as a “gentle guide” that supports insight without directing the user’s conclusions. The AI’s contributions include: helping with sentence evolution (suggesting phrasing or completion in Column 2), performing pattern recognition (noticing repeated beliefs or defects), offering emotionally attuned prompts (adjusting language to user’s emotional state), and discerning hidden motives or fear patterns in the user’s narrative . It is critical that the AI’s tone and content remain spiritually aligned, non-judgmental, and never doctrinal. We must carefully craft prompts to ensure the AI mirrors the app’s spiritual philosophy: emphasizing honesty, open-mindedness, willingness, and reliance on a higher purpose, yet never preaching.

Prompting Style: Use non-directive, Socratic prompting in all AI interactions. Instead of telling the user what their problem or solution is, the AI should ask questions or make gentle observations that the user can take or leave. For example, rather than “It looks like you have a fear of abandonment,” the AI can prompt: “I wonder if a fear of being left or abandoned might be hiding underneath this resentment?” – phrased as a curiosity for the user to confirm or deny. The AI might also mirror what the user said in a compassionate way: “You mentioned feeling disrespected; feeling that way can be really painful. What do you believe it meant about you when that happened?” This approach draws the user deeper without diagnosing them, which is important. The AI should never label the user with terms like “You are X” or “You have Y issue.” It stays in first-person or second-person respectful address, keeping the user (and perhaps their notion of a Higher Power) as the agent of change. We will build a prompt template for the LLM such as: “You are a compassionate spiritual assistant helping the user reflect on a resentment. The user’s statements and prior answers are given. Provide a gentle, wise question or insight that can help them see a spiritual truth or pattern, without giving direct advice or judgment. Use the language of spiritual principles (e.g. honesty, fear, trust, humility) but do not reference any religious doctrine directly. Keep it brief and open-ended.” By instructing the LLM with rules (no direct instructions, no judgmental language, emphasize principles), we align it with the required tone .

Surfacing Beliefs and Fears: One key AI task is to help surface the underlying beliefs in Column 2 and the hidden fears or ego themes in Column 3. The app will maintain a curated list of common limiting beliefs (as identified in the design document) to assist this process . These include beliefs around Control/Expectations (“people should follow my rules”), Recognition/Worth (“if they loved me, they’d know what I need”), Justice/Fairness, Fear/Security (“if I’m not in control, something bad will happen”), and Entitlement/Ego (“I deserve better than this”) . Similarly, Column 3’s ego substructures each hide a particular fear (e.g. fear of inferiority behind pride, fear of rejection behind dependency, etc.) . The AI can use these lists as options to suggest to the user. For example, after the user describes a cause and feelings, the AI might respond with: “It sounds like you expected a certain respect that you didn’t receive. Perhaps a belief like ‘People should treat me with respect if they care’ is present – does that feel true for you?” It could even present a couple of choices: “Which resonates more with you: ‘I deserve to be treated better’ or ‘If I’m not respected, I feel worthless’?” – allowing the user to pick the belief that fits, or articulate their own. By doing so, the AI mirrors spiritual insight without force. This process should be implemented as suggestions, not fill-in-the-blank. The user always has the final say on what their belief is; the AI is just a catalyst if the user feels stuck identifying it. Internally, using the LLM for this might involve either a classification approach (feeding the entry text and asking the model to classify which belief category it matches best) or a generative approach (having the model produce a sentence like the user’s possible belief). We should test prompts like “Analyze the user’s statements and identify what core belief or expectation they might have. Use the format: ‘Belief – [statement]’.” Then parse the LLM output. A combination of rule-based hints (search for keywords like “should”, “deserve”, “always”) and LLM flexibility might yield the best results.

Ego/Defect Theme Detection: Similarly, when the user reaches Column 4 (Defects/Blocks), the AI can help identify character defects involved. The user doc lists core defects: selfishness, dishonesty, self-seeking, and fear as drivers , as well as a longer list of variants (pride, envy, control, etc.) . The app might let the user manually choose defects from a list, but an AI assist could observe the narrative and highlight likely defects. For instance, if the story indicates the user tried to control others, the AI could note: “I notice control and fear might be factors here.” Again, phrased as observation: “Perhaps this resentment involves some self-centered fear – the fear that if you don’t control things, they’ll go wrong?” . This aligns with 12-step language (fear is often called the “corroding thread”). The AI’s identification of defects must be done carefully and kindly – defects are essentially personal flaws, and hearing them bluntly could trigger shame. So the AI should couch defects as common human traits or “blocks” rather than accusations. E.g. “Many of us fall into dishonesty with ourselves in these situations – do you sense any denial or dishonesty in how you handled this?” By normalizing it (“many of us”), the AI avoids making the user feel uniquely bad.

Spiritual Alignment of AI Responses: To maintain a spiritual tone, we can infuse the AI’s prompt or few-shot examples with language from spiritual teachings (non-sectarian). For example, referencing concepts like “self-will vs God’s will”, “letting go”, “being right-sized (humility)” can resonate with users familiar with 12-step, but we must not assume too much religious language. The app might refer to “Higher Power” or “the Universe” if it’s part of the user’s lexicon, but since it’s personal, perhaps avoid having the AI mention God/Higher Power unless the user does first. One safe approach is to have the AI emphasize spiritual principles rather than deities. For instance, instead of “pray for them,” the AI could suggest “practice compassion or forgiveness toward them” – implying spiritual action without doctrinal language. The prompt guidelines for the LLM should explicitly say to avoid preaching or quoting scripture; keep it user-centered (their experience) and principle-focused. When the user reaches Column 5 (the solution/asset), the AI can again help by suggesting positive spiritual actions or attitudes the user might take, drawn from a predefined list of assets (humility, honesty, patience, compassion, forgiveness, etc.) . If the user seems unsure what “to do instead,” the AI might gently propose: “Perhaps the spiritual antidote here could be forgiveness or patience. Which of these feels right as an opposite of your anger?” – thereby helping them choose an asset to cultivate . Importantly, this is not generic self-help advice but tied to the specific defect they identified. The AI should make that connection: e.g. “To counteract the anger and hurt (and the pride beneath it), maybe practicing humility – like admitting your own imperfections – could help. Does that sound like a good principle to try?” This ties the solution to the problem identified and keeps the focus on action and change rather than wallowing. All AI suggestions here should be optional for the user to accept or reject.

Avoiding AI Overreach: As a rule, AI output should be treated as suggestions and the UI should reflect that. Visually, perhaps show AI prompts or insights in a distinct way (maybe italic text or prefaced with something like “🤖 Insight:” or a character like a guide). The user could then tap to incorporate an AI suggestion or just ignore it. For example, in Column 2 belief suggestion, display a short list of 2-3 possible beliefs as chips the user can tap to select, or they can type their own. This ensures the user remains in control and doesn’t feel the app is telling them what to think. We also recommend logging all AI outputs and letting the user rate or flag them if something felt off. This feedback loop can help refine prompt engineering. Given the sensitive nature, we should also put guardrails in the AI prompt: instruct the LLM to avoid certain content – e.g., no mention of self-harm, no encouraging any violence or blaming. If a user’s content is extremely heavy (e.g. involves trauma like abuse), the AI should not produce any response that could be interpreted as minimization or urging them to find their part in abuse (which would be retraumatizing, as noted in literature about misapplication of inventory) . Instead, for situations of true victimization, the AI might respond with validation and perhaps a very gentle question of feeling (e.g. “That sounds extremely hurtful. How did this affect your view of yourself?”) rather than implying they’re “wrong for being angry” – avoiding the pitfall of spiritual bypass or victim-blaming in the name of inventory . Achieving this nuance may require careful testing with example scenarios.

Tech Stack for AI: For MVP, using a reliable cloud-based LLM like OpenAI’s GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 turbo) or Anthropic’s Claude is the fastest path to get high-quality spiritual language generation. These models have the capacity to handle the nuance if well prompted. GPT-4, for instance, can follow complex style instructions and produce empathetic, context-aware responses (at a cost). Claude has an extremely large context window which could be useful if we want to feed in the user’s entire inventory history for pattern analysis at some point. However, privacy concerns mean we must do this only with explicit user consent and ideally strip personal identifiers. We could use an intermediate layer: for example, replace actual names in the prompt with generic tokens (“[Person A]”) before sending to the API, to protect privacy, since who the resentment is about is less important than the nature of it. Another consideration: since the app is non-commercial/spiritually focused, we might not have large resources for API costs, so calls should be minimized. We can limit AI usage to key points (like after the user fills a column or when they request insight) rather than a continuous back-and-forth chat. Each such call can be on the order of a few hundred tokens – which is manageable. We’ll also ensure the API is called securely (HTTPS) and that we do not log the content on our servers. If possible, using OpenAI’s user data protection settings (they allow opting out of data retention) is a must, or use Azure’s OpenAI if needing more control.

In the long run, we can explore local or on-device AI models to avoid external calls. By 2025, smaller fine-tuned models (like Llama 2 13B or a specialized model for reflective journaling) could potentially run on high-end mobile hardware with quantization, but it might not match GPT-4’s quality. For MVP, a hybrid approach could be: use local NLP for simpler tasks (keyword spotting for fears/defects) and call the heavy LLM only for the nuanced reflective prompts. This would reduce data sharing. Always be transparent: inform the user “When you use the AI-guided insight feature, the text of your entry will be sent securely to an AI service (e.g. OpenAI) for processing.” and get their consent (perhaps a toggle in settings “Enable AI guidance”). This way, users who are uncomfortable can opt out entirely and use the app fully offline with just the manual prompts.

Privacy-Conscious Integration
Privacy-First Philosophy: The inventory data users put into Perspective is deeply personal and “sacred – not commercialized” . The app must treat this data with utmost care. Concretely, no data leaves the device without the user’s informed consent . The default mode should be offline/local for journaling. If the user enables cloud features (like AI or sponsor sharing), we implement robust safeguards.

Local Data Security: On-device, store entries in an encrypted form. iOS offers file system encryption by default, but for extra protection we could use the Keychain or an encrypted database. A lightweight approach: use Core Data or SQLite and enable SQLCipher for encryption, using a key derived from the user’s passcode or a password. Alternatively, since MVP might not involve user accounts (could be purely local usage), simply rely on iOS’s hardware encryption and mark the data as sensitive. Provide an export/backup option so the user can download their inventory (e.g. as JSON or PDF) for their records or to transfer to a new device, again stressing that it stays in their control. Also allow deletion of data at any time – e.g. a “Delete Entry” and “Delete All Data” function – to honor user ownership . No analytics or tracking SDKs should be in this app; at most, basic anonymized metrics if needed for improving (and even that might be avoided initially).

AI Integration and Consent: As mentioned, any use of external AI APIs must be wrapped in a consent flow. The first time the user invokes an AI-driven feature, explain what will happen: e.g. “Perspective uses OpenAI’s GPT service to provide spiritual reflections. This means some of your writing will be sent to OpenAI’s servers for processing. Your data is encrypted in transit and not stored permanently by us. Do you agree to proceed?” – with Yes/No. Also provide a setting to toggle AI features on/off easily. For users who opt out, ensure the app still functions (just without AI suggestions – perhaps have a manual mode with static tips instead). If the user opts in, minimize what data is sent. For instance, if asking the AI for help on Column 3, you might only send Column 1 and 2 content relevant to that, not the user’s entire journal. This data minimization principle reduces exposure. Additionally, consider using an anonymization step as noted: we can programmatically replace specific names or places with generic labels before sending to AI. The AI can work with “[Friend] didn’t show up to meet me” just as well as a real name, and this way even if the API were compromised, it’s harder to link data to a real person.

Secure Transmission & Storage: All network communication (if any) must be over HTTPS with modern TLS. If we end up implementing a backend (for example, to facilitate sponsor sharing or to route API calls), that server should not log content and should store anything transiently if at all. A possibility for sponsor sharing: rather than uploading inventories to our servers, we could leverage end-to-end encrypted sharing. For example, the app could generate an encryption key pair; the sponsor’s app and sponsee’s app exchange public keys (maybe via scanning a QR code or entering a code from the “gift” feature). Then a specific inventory entry can be encrypted with the sponsor’s public key and sent through a lightweight cloud relay (or even via iCloud share, etc.). This is complex for MVP, so likely sponsor sharing might be deferred or done via a simpler method (like exporting a PDF to send to sponsor manually). In any case, if sharing exists, it should be read-only for the sponsor unless user invites collaboration.

API Keys & Local Inference: If using third-party APIs (Whisper, GPT, etc.), secure the keys. Do not hard-code in the app binary; retrieve from a secure endpoint or use Apple’s device management. However, since we emphasize on-device solutions (e.g. on-device Whisper, possible local model use), it reduces reliance on keys. Investigate Apple’s on-device ASR – by 2025, Apple’s Neural Engine and speech models might allow full offline dictation for English. If that’s viable, use it, as it simplifies things (just need the user to grant microphone permission, no internet needed).

User Identity and Anonymity: Since this app is highly personal, consider letting users remain pseudonymous. It might not require a login at all (store data locally). If an account system is needed (e.g. to sync across devices or use the sponsor gift code), allow using just an email or even an offline code. The design document suggests a sponsor can gift the app via a code – this could be done without the sponsee revealing their identity to us (the code could unlock a “pro” version or such). The user’s name is used inside the app for prompts (they insert their first name which the app uses like “What do you, [Name], feel…?”) . Ensure that name is stored only locally. If the user chooses to put their real name, fine, but we might encourage just first name or even a nickname for privacy. Internally, treat even that name as sensitive (don’t send it to AI prompts; use “X” or a placeholder as shown in the doc to keep prompts generic ).

Local AI (future considerations): We mentioned exploring local ML for privacy. Whisper can be local (though heavy). For LLM, currently it’s tough to run a GPT-4-level model on device, but smaller models (6B-13B parameters) can run with quantization on a high-end phone. These might handle simpler tasks like classification of text into fear categories or generating short reflections if fine-tuned on spiritual text. One idea: fine-tune an open model on a dataset of 12-step literature and reflections, to imbue it with the jargon and tone, then run that locally. It likely won’t be as coherent, but could be an offline “insight generator” for those who refuse any net connection. This is an advanced avenue – for MVP we stick to ensuring that even with cloud AI, the user is fully aware and in control of what goes out.

No Ads, No Tracking, No Monetization of Data: Being non-commercial, the app will presumably be free or one-time purchase (with sponsors potentially gifting it). Emphasize that we do not and will not monetize user data or activity. In the UI (perhaps in a Privacy & Ethics section), explicitly state commitments: e.g. “Your inventory is yours alone. Perspective does not even see your entries unless you explicitly choose to share or use cloud AI. No advertising or selling of data – ever.” This transparency builds trust, which is vital for users to actually use the app for its intended depth.

Trauma-Informed UX Design
Designing Perspective with a trauma-informed approach means creating an experience that prioritizes user safety, empowerment, and trust at every step . Many users may be dealing with past trauma or high vulnerability, so the UX must be gentle and accommodating.

Safety and Calm: The app’s look and feel should invoke a sense of safety. Use a clean, uncluttered interface (the spec calls for “Zen-like simplicity” ) with plenty of white space or gentle backgrounds (e.g. soft gradient or neutral solid colors). Avoid any startling visuals or loud sounds. Transitions between screens or prompts should be softly animated (e.g. a slow fade or slide, rather than jarring pops) . This gives users a moment to breathe when moving to the next step, rather than feeling pushed. For example, after completing a heavy section like Column 3 (where they dig into fears and wounds), the app might briefly fade to a neutral screen with an encouraging quote or simply a breathing graphic, before moving on. This acts as a buffer so they can emotionally catch up – a practice known as layered disclosure, where you don’t pile one intense thing immediately after another without a break.

Trustworthiness & Transparency: Be very clear about what the app is doing and why. If the app suggests something via AI, maybe include a small info icon that says “Why am I seeing this suggestion?” explaining it’s based on common patterns and not a judgment. If any data is being processed or saved, communicate it (e.g. a sync icon if uploading to cloud, etc.). Also, ensure the app behaves consistently – no random surprises. For instance, if tapping a certain button always moves to the next prompt, don’t suddenly change that behavior. This consistency builds a sense of control for the user, which trauma survivors especially need .

Empowerment, Choice & Control: At every juncture, the user should feel they are in the driver’s seat. The app is a guide, not a drill sergeant. This means providing options and respecting “no.” If the user doesn’t want to answer a particular prompt right now, allow them to skip it or mark it for later without penalty. For example, maybe they aren’t ready to identify their part in a particular harm – let them leave Column 4 blank and still move on, perhaps with a gentle note like “Skip for now? You can return to this when you feel ready.”. Include toggleable prompts for deeper exploration: some users will want every insight question under the sun, others will want just the basic flow. A solution is to have a “More Insight” button after each section that, when tapped, reveals additional questions or AI reflections for those who desire to go deeper. If not tapped, the app simply proceeds. This respects the user’s right to dose their own experience. It aligns with the suggestion of a “toggle or layered view” for complex parts like Column 3, rather than a rigid checklist they must slog through . Also, incorporate undo and edit freedom – nothing in the app should feel final or locked. Users can always edit an entry, revisit a previous answer, or even delete something they wrote in a moment of anger. This ability to revise can be therapeutic (since perspective can change, and the app should accommodate growth).

Avoid Triggers and Judgment: The language throughout must be carefully vetted for anything that could trigger shame or trauma. Phrases that blame or judge are absolutely out. For instance, instead of “What mistakes did you make that caused this?” (very harsh), the app uses the phrasing from the design doc: “What did you do to set in motion…?” – a more factual tone. Also, avoid pathologizing language. We never say things like “your problem” or “your defect” bluntly; we might say “character defect” as it’s common 12-step jargon, but even there, the app could use softer synonyms like “shortcoming” or “block” in many places to reduce stigma. The design explicitly says no diagnosis or prescription – this extends to not even sounding like we’re labeling the user. Another example: In prompt text, prefer inclusive phrasing like “we” or “us” when talking about defects (“We often find we have been dishonest with ourselves…”) so the user doesn’t feel singled out.

No Gamification or Pressure: Many apps use gamification (streaks, badges, daily push reminders) to increase engagement, but for a trauma-informed spiritual app, that can be counterproductive. Users should never feel punished or guilt-tripped by the app. So, no streak counters that reset to zero if they miss a day, no achievement badges like “5 resentments completed!” which could be weird and imply doing more inventories is a game. The design mandate is “no metrics, no gamification, no judgment” , which we follow strictly. Progress in this app is non-linear and internal – the user defines success, not an app metric. Therefore, instead of “daily reminders” that could cause guilt (“You haven’t written today!”), any notifications should be opt-in and gentle. For example, an optional “Evening reminder” that says “Time for a gentle evening reflection? 📖” which the user can enable or disable. If they miss it, the app should not harp on it. The absence of heavy gamification itself is trauma-informed – it avoids creating feelings of failure or competition.

Support and Resources: A trauma-informed app should consider providing safety nets. Include a section (perhaps in Settings or a subtle “Help” menu) with resources for emotional crisis. For instance, “If you are feeling overwhelmed or unsafe, consider reaching out to a professional or trusted friend. Here are some resources: [List crisis hotline or relevant support line].” This kind of content acknowledges that the work can stir up hard feelings and that it’s okay to seek help beyond the app. Also, consider including grounding exercises for users who get triggered. For example, a simple guided breathing or a 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding exercise in the app’s help section. Even a quick breathing break feature: at any point, maybe the user can tap an icon (like a little cloud or pause symbol) that takes them to a 1-minute guided breathing or a calming visual, then they can return to where they left off. This respects the principle of safety – giving users tools to self-soothe if needed, instead of pushing on when they’re not ready.

Visual and Interaction Design: Use fonts and colors that are easy on the eyes. Large enough text, high contrast (but not stark black/white – maybe dark gray on off-white), and possibly a dark mode for those who prefer. Imagery, if used, should be symbolic or nature-based, not personal photos or anything that could be misinterpreted. Perhaps abstract illustrations that evoke growth, perspective, or serenity (e.g. a path leading to sunlight, a tree, etc.). The Figma design likely already has an aesthetic – align with it by maintaining consistency (e.g. if they use certain iconography or a particular minimalist style, stick to that).

One detail is the use of the user’s name in prompts (e.g. “What do you, John, feel…”) . This can feel personalized and engaging, but ensure it’s done in a way that doesn’t startle. Perhaps only use the name occasionally for emphasis, not every single prompt, to avoid an overly stern tone (sometimes repeating one’s name can feel scolding). Test with real users to see if it feels supportive.

Collaboration & Peer Support: Trauma-informed design also values peer support and collaboration . In this app’s context, that means recognizing the role of sponsors or fellow 12-step travelers. The feature to allow a sponsor to gift the app and potentially view the sponsee’s progress (with permission) leverages that peer support. UX-wise, if a user does invite a sponsor to view, make that experience feel safe too: perhaps a special view where the user can see exactly what the sponsor will see (transparency). Also, allow the user to toggle sharing on a per-entry basis – they might want to share some inventories but not others. And if the sponsor comments or gives feedback outside the app, that’s beyond our scope, but the app itself should not have a public feed or comments, to keep it a private journal space.

Cultural Sensitivity: Being spiritually focused, ensure the app’s language is inclusive of different beliefs. For example, not every user will be comfortable with the word “God” – many 12-step folks use “Higher Power” or other terms. The content should reflect that flexibility (the design doc already uses “Higher Power or energy” in places ). Possibly in settings, allow the user to choose a preferred term for the divine (or no term), and reflect that in prompts. Also be mindful of gendered language or examples – keep them neutral (the Big Book text is old and male-oriented; this app can modernize it). This falls under cultural/historical awareness in trauma-informed principles , making sure language or examples don’t alienate or re-traumatize anyone (e.g. avoid any “father/son” type religious language, etc., unless the user themselves uses it).

Testing with empathy: As part of development, do some UX testing with actual members of the recovery community if possible (who are comfortable testing). They can flag if anything in the flow feels uncomfortable or rushed. Adopt an iterative approach: since this is a new kind of app, be open to adjusting text or features if feedback shows it inadvertently causes anxiety.

By implementing these trauma-informed practices, Perspective will provide an emotionally safe container for users to do the difficult work of inventory. The app essentially becomes a compassionate companion, not just a tool.

Spiritual Insight Systems
This section covers special UX and logic features that deliver spiritual insights to the user, beyond the basic fill-in of inventory columns. Two notable features are the Reverse Reading experience and detection of spiritual bypass vs. genuine surrender, as well as highlighting the interconnected flow of assets, defects, beliefs, and events.

Reverse Reading UX: Once an entry is completed (Columns 1–5 filled), the app shifts into a reflection mode to “reconstruct the resentment’s emotional and spiritual logic” from outcome to cause . The idea is to guide the user to read their entry backwards: starting with the spiritual solution and tracing back to the original resentment, illustrating how a change in perspective can unwind the resentment. In practice, implement a dedicated screen or modal for Reverse Reading . This screen might display a title like “Perspective Gained” and then list something like:
• Spiritual Asset (Action): Humility (Column 5)
• Defect (Self-block): Pride (Column 4)
• Threatened Self (Injury): Self-Esteem – felt disrespected (Column 3)
• Belief (Distortion): “I must always be treated with respect to have worth.” (Column 2, belief layer)
• Event (Resentment Story): They played loud music and ignored me. (Column 1/2 event detail)

And then perhaps a narrative sentence that connects these: e.g. “Because they ignored me, I felt disrespected, which threatened my self-esteem and led me to believe ‘I deserve unwavering respect.’ This belief, driven by pride, blocked me spiritually. By practicing humility instead, I can dissolve the resentment.” This essentially spells out the asset→defect→threat→belief→event chain . The design doc suggests the app will automatically narrate this reverse entry , possibly with an audio voiceover or at least visually step-by-step. A compelling UX could be to animate this chain: start by showing the final asset (perhaps with a radiant icon or color), then slide in the defect it counteracts, then the threat, then the belief, then the initial event – each new reveal could be accompanied by a brief explanatory subtitle. For example, next to “Defect: Pride” it might show in smaller text “(the block that kept you from humility)”. This visual mapping helps the user literally see how each layer connects .

To deepen impact, use reflection playback: consider a feature where the app can read aloud the reverse narrative (using TTS) while highlighting each part on screen . The voice should be calm and clear. This is like listening to your story in a healed form, which can be powerful. It’s essentially the “spiritual mirror” mentioned – hearing it can reinforce ownership and release. Technically, you would construct a string for the narrative and feed it to AVSpeechSynthesizer. Provide controls (play/pause, maybe a replay button), and ensure accessibility (e.g. closed-caption the narration for those who can’t hear audio well). Some users may find audio too much, so it should be optional – perhaps default to just visual text, with a “🔊 Play Reflection” button.

Bypass vs. Surrender Detection: Spiritual bypass is a risk in any spiritual work – it’s when someone uses spiritual concepts to avoid facing their real emotions or issues . In the context of this app, bypass might look like a user quickly writing “I forgave them, it’s all okay” without actually processing their anger, or constantly intellectualizing instead of feeling. On the other hand, surrender is the genuine letting go that comes after fully acknowledging and accepting the truth (including one’s feelings and faults). The app should be attuned to signs of bypass and gently call attention to them, encouraging a more honest surrender.

Detecting Bypass: Potential signals include: extremely short entries that jump straight to “solution” without much emotion (e.g. if a user in Column 2 writes only a very brief or neutral cause, or in Column 3/4 writes “none” or “N/A” indicating they claim nothing was affected or they had no defect – possibly denying feelings). Another sign is overly pious or overly positive language prematurely – e.g. “I know I shouldn’t feel angry because everything happens for a reason.” That can be a rationalization. The AI or logic could scan for certain patterns: mentions of “I shouldn’t feel…” or “I already let it go” at a very early stage. If detected, the app might respond with a gentle nudge: “It sounds like you’re moving to forgiveness very quickly. Make sure you’re not skipping over any hurt or resentment that might still be there – it’s okay to acknowledge it.” This reinforces that all feelings are valid and need to be felt (an antidote to bypassing) . The design doc even notes “No God in it → spiritual bypass” as something to recognize . That likely means if the user is talking the talk but not actually involving a true spiritual surrender (or conversely if they’re doing it all by willpower and not asking a Higher Power for help, which could also be a bypass of the true spiritual solution). The app might notice if in Column 5 the user picks a rather superficial action or writes something that sounds like self-will (“I’ll just avoid that person”) instead of a spiritual principle – that could be flagged as maybe not a full surrender.

Encouraging Surrender: When the user does reach a point of genuine acceptance (for example, they identify their defect and express willingness to have it removed, or they choose a compassionate action in Column 5), the app can reinforce and encourage that. This might be as simple as a positive affirmation on completion: “You’ve taken an honest look and chosen humility over pride – that’s a big step toward freedom.” The line between encouragement and gamification is careful here; we’re not “rewarding” them, but acknowledging the courage it takes. Perhaps quoting a short relevant line from 12-step literature about surrender could be used (the design doc quotes Big Book p.66 about looking from a new angle ). Could incorporate such a quote when transitioning from Column 3 to 4 (as in the doc) to inspire surrender: “’We were prepared to look at it from an entirely different angle.’ – This might be the moment to do that.” .

Implementation: We can utilize the LLM to check for bypass indicators. For example, after Column 2 or 3, have a hidden prompt like: “The user wrote the following. Does it appear they are minimizing their feelings or jumping to forgiveness (spiritual bypass)? Answer yes or no and a one-sentence reasoning.” If “yes”, the app could then present a tailored prompt to the user. Even without AI, some simple keyword heuristics might catch common bypass phrases as mentioned. However, caution: we don’t want false positives where we accuse the user of bypassing when they actually genuinely are fine. The approach should be more observational: e.g. “Sometimes we tell ourselves we’re fine when we still carry hurt. Double-check: do you feel any remaining resentment or fear here?” – basically encouraging thoroughness. If the user truly is fine, they can just move on.

Asset-Defect-Belief-Event Highlighting: We want users to clearly see the flow of cause and effect in their spiritual inventory. One way is through the reverse reading chain (discussed above). Additionally, during the normal forward process, we could use visual cues to link columns. For example, when the user identifies a belief in Column 2, mark that belief text with an icon (say a small cloud icon). Then in Column 3, when they pick what was threatened (say self-esteem), mark that with another icon (a heart or person icon). Then in Column 4, their defect (maybe “pride”) gets a fire icon, and Column 5 asset (“humility”) a light icon. On the reverse reading screen or elsewhere, those icons and colors line up to show the connections: humility (light) vs pride (fire), self-esteem hurt (heart) healed by humility, etc. This is a design flourish that can make the abstract concepts more tangible. The doc highlights “highlighting how it unfolded” – which is exactly this: you could even highlight words in the original narrative that correspond to those parts (maybe not in MVP, but an idea: highlight the sentence “disrespected” in red to link it to pride, etc.). The main goal is to help the user realize their resentment isn’t a random mess; it has a structure and thus can be worked through – a key insight in 12-step inventories.

Realizations and Reframing: The design includes a “Realisations” stage between Column 3 and 4 . This is where the user looks at themselves from new angles: how am I the same as the person I resent? Do I do this to myself? What did it really cost me? etc. . We should incorporate those questions (they’re basically part of the inventory process Big Book suggests). The app can treat this as a brief reflection interlude: maybe a separate screen with those 3 questions and the user can jot a quick answer or at least think about them. These realizations directly feed the willingness to change in Column 4. Emphasize here the insight like in the doc: “It felt like WINNING, but I was actually LOSING” – meaning holding onto resentment felt like power but it was actually harming me . This kind of line could be presented after they answer the realisation prompts, to help reframe perspective. Possibly randomize or select an appropriate insight quote to display (from a bank of such insights).

“Bypassing vs Surrendering” indicator: We might include a subtle indicator of the user’s state in terms of letting go. Not as a score, but something like a text that says “Inventory in Progress: Holding On” vs “Inventory Completed: Letting Go”. If the user hasn’t filled certain columns or shows signs of bypass, the status might remain “Holding On (Incomplete)”. When they truly go through all parts and choose a spiritual action, mark it as “Released” or similar. This is speculative, and we must be cautious as it might be seen as evaluation. But framing it as process, not judgement (everyone starts at holding on, and ends at release typically if they do the work) could be a gentle nudge to finish the process fully. The user doc implies the goal is to move from “confession to clarity to change” – perhaps the app can reflect these phases.

Continuous Insight & Theme Tracking: Over time, as the user does multiple inventories, the app can provide higher-level insights. For MVP, a simple approach is a summary like: “Top 3 beliefs you’ve written about: ‘I’m not enough’ (4 times), ‘I must control everything’ (3 times), ‘I’ll be hurt if I trust’ (2 times).” Or “The defect that appears most in your inventories is Fear (in 5 entries). Your most practiced asset is Honesty (in 5 entries).” These sorts of stats (without saying “bad user, you have lots of fear” – rather just factual) can help the user see growth areas. Ideally present such things in a positive growth context: for instance, if over time the proportion of entries where they identify the asset of “trust” is increasing, note that as a positive trend. This might be more for later versions, but laying groundwork by tagging data now (as earlier described) will enable it.

Nonlinear Practices and Daily Integration
Beyond the formal inventory process, Perspective should support the user’s daily spiritual practice, notably 10th and 11th Step activities, in a nonlinear, user-friendly way. This means providing tools for evening review, morning meditation, and spontaneous check-ins that complement the deep inventories.

Evening Review (Step 11 Nightly): Implement a Nightly Review mode that the user can invoke each evening (or whenever convenient) to gently examine their day . This feature can be a short sequence of questions derived from AA’s Big Book (p.86) which the design doc lists . Key questions include: “Were you resentful, selfish, dishonest or afraid today?”; “Do you owe an apology or amends?”; “What could you have done better?”; “Were you kind and loving?” . The UX for this could be a form or voice dialogue that takes only a few minutes. Possibly present each question one at a time for the user to answer via voice or text. The answers can be stored as a daily log (perhaps separate from the main inventory entries, or flagged as daily reviews). Since this is a repetitive practice, keep it lightweight and optional. The user might not do it every single day, and that’s fine. If a user hasn’t used the feature in a while, the app could offer a gentle reminder or prompt like “How about a quick evening reflection?” but not pester. Also incorporate the caution from the Big Book: “Don’t drift into worry, remorse or morbid reflection – that diminishes usefulness to others.” . Perhaps after the user answers the questions, if they seem to be beating themselves up, the app can respond with that reminder not to get stuck in regret, and encourage corrective action (like “Okay, you identified where you were off track. Now ask your Higher Power’s forgiveness and retire for the night.”) Indeed the Big Book suggests prayer for forgiveness and guidance after the review – we can include a closing prompt: “Now, let it go – ask your Higher Power for forgiveness and guidance, then thank yourself for doing this review.” The user could check off that they did that prayer.

Morning Meditation (Step 11 Morning): Similarly, provide a Morning Practice mode . This might be more informational or priming rather than something the user writes a lot in. The design doc outlines: reviewing the day’s plans, asking for guidance, ensuring our thought-life is free from self-pity/dishonesty/self-seeking, etc. . The app can present a short script or checklist each morning: e.g.
• “Take a moment to center yourself. (Maybe a 10-second breathing animation plays.)”
• “Preview your day: What’s on your agenda? Visualize it going smoothly under spiritual guidance.” (User can optionally jot a note or just tap next.)
• “Prayer for alignment: ‘Please free me from self-will. Let my thoughts be divorced from self-pity, dishonesty, self-seeking and fear. Show me what my next step is to be, and give me whatever I need to take care of today.’” . (We can have a nice written prayer or even an audio play of it; also encourage the user to use their own words if they prefer.)
• “When unsure or indecisive today, remember: pause, ask for inspiration, relax and take it easy. Don’t struggle.” . (This could be just a tip shown.)
• End with perhaps a positive affirmation or mantra (see below).

We can condense the Big Book content into a friendly morning routine that takes maybe 1-2 minutes. If a user wants more, we could link to external readings or allow them to journal an intention for the day.

Midday and “Spot-Check” Inventories (Step 10): Encourage intuitive check-ins throughout the day. This could be implemented as a quick-access feature: e.g. a button on the app’s home screen or maybe even a widget/Siri shortcut that does a “Spot Check.” This would be like: “Pause. What are you feeling right now? Any resentment or fear popped up? Take a quick inventory:” Then a mini-flow: Who/what’s the resentment? what’s the feeling? what’s the belief or fear? what can you do now (amends or letting go)? – essentially a mini 4th/10th step done on the fly. Keep it short. The user might speak a sentence or two, and that’s it – it gets logged as a spot-check entry. This can help users handle things in real-time and not accumulate large resentments. It’s nonlinear because it’s user-initiated whenever. The app can also detect from user’s daily usage if they seem agitated (hard to know) but maybe not get into that. A simple gentle nudge could be a “Midday pause” reminder around lunch: “🕊️ Take a moment. Are you feeling agitated or doubtful? Pause, ask for the right thought or action.” – which echoes the AA instruction for midday . This could be a notification the user opts into at a set time, delivering that quote. It’s not asking them to open the app necessarily, just a mindful push that might help them recalibrate.

Embedded Mantras & Alerts: As noted, include mantras like “Thy will be done.” The design doc specifically mentions repeating this throughout the day . We can support that by maybe having the phrase subtly present in the app UI (like on the home screen or a pull-down banner: “Thy will be done” as a reminder of surrender). Also, an Apple Watch companion or just simple notifications can display a mantra at chosen times. For instance, user can set a 3pm daily alert that just says “🌤️ Thy will, not mine, be done.” This is a light alert – no interaction needed, just a spiritual whisper in their day. It must be configurable (some users might choose a different mantra or none at all). The key is these alerts should never scold or create obligation, only inspire. They should also be infrequent; possibly the app could have a mantra of the day that user activates if they want, rather than multiple notifications.

Reflection Pathways Without Advice: All these practices – night review, morning, spot-check – should deepen the user’s spiritual life without ever crossing into telling them what to do in specific life situations. The app is not a life coach or counselor. It provides structure and questions, but not answers. For example, in a nightly review if a user notes they owe an amends, the app can suggest in general “Make plans to apologize where necessary,” but it should not explicitly say “Go apologize to X tomorrow.” The user’s own conscience or sponsor should guide that decision. Similarly, if the user identifies a character defect in an entry, the app doesn’t say “Work on being less selfish this week by volunteering” – it simply might congratulate them on the awareness and remind “progress, not perfection – you’re growing.” The non-directive stance is maintained across features. This also means no over-promising (“do this and you’ll be happy!”) – the app stays humble in tone.

Integration with Figma Design & Aesthetics: As we incorporate these UX features, we align with the visual style envisioned. Likely the Figma has a home screen with options like “Inventory”, “Evening Review”, “Morning”, etc., possibly as cards or buttons. We should maintain the same typography, icon style, and spacing as designed. If the aesthetic is minimalistic (e.g. mostly text on solid background, maybe line art icons), stick to that for any new element (like a breathing exercise screen or mantra notification). Also ensure the tone of writing is consistent: possibly the Figma/prototype uses certain wording that resonates spiritually. Mirror that style in any new microcopy we add (like instructions or button labels). For instance, if the primary button style says “Begin” instead of “Start”, use the same voice.

Finally, consider that these daily practice features, while not as “heavy” as the formal inventory, contribute to user retention and real-life change. Implement them in a way that they feel like a natural extension of the inventory process – essentially helping the user live what they learn from inventories. The loop is: Inventory gives insight, daily practices help maintain spiritual condition, which in turn leads to fewer resentments and a happier life. The app’s job is to facilitate that loop gently.

Trade-Offs & Notes: In building Perspective, there’s a clear tension to balance: we want to use modern tech (voice, AI) to ease and enrich the experience, but we must do so without violating the sacred, personal nature of the process. We’ve opted for privacy and safety even if it means limiting some functionality (e.g. using on-device processing where possible, making AI optional). This might slightly reduce the “wow” factor of an all-knowing AI coach, but it’s the right call for user trust. Technically, implementing voice and AI features will require careful iteration and perhaps using cutting-edge libraries (like Whisper, GPT) in new ways on mobile – which could challenge performance on older devices. We assume primarily recent iPhones will be targeted for best experience (as Whisper’s requirements suggest A12 Bionic or above ).

For development, consider using SwiftUI for the interface to achieve those smooth transitions and maintainable UI code. SwiftUI also integrates well with voice APIs and is future-forward on iOS. Leverage Combine or async/await for managing the real-time speech input and AI call responses, to keep the app responsive.

In conclusion, Perspective’s MVP will combine a robust five-column inventory framework with innovative voice and AI support, all wrapped in an interface that feels like a gentle, wise friend. By keeping the user’s emotional safety and spiritual agency at the center, the app can truly fulfill its mission to “make the inventory experience easy…providing emotional safety and intuitive flow” , guiding users from confession to clarity to change in a humane, respectful way.
